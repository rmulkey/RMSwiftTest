RMSwiftTest
===========

My first Swift project. 

It intends to consume REST API's from popular social networks and sites such as Twitter, Reddit, Flickr and RSS Feeds. Any comments or suggestions are welcome. Feel free to make a Pull Request or to fork the project.


Thoughts on Swift
=================

I HATE THAT ALL MY GOOGLE SEARCHES BRING UP TAYLOR SWIFT STUFF lol 

Feels great so far. There are a lot of characteristics present in other modern programming languages, in particular Ruby. I like the sintax. No more pointers, no more header files, you don't have to explicitly declare variable types, no more semi-colons at the end of each line (well, these are optional now, but I think that the code looks cleaner without them), no more funky square brackets, no more NS prefixes on every object, no more Mutable types such as NSMutableDictionary and NSMutableArray (you can set a variable to mutable using 'var' and to immutable/constant using 'let').

Tuples are a great addition. Generic arguments and parameters can be passed to functions. PLAYGROUND IS AWESOME!

One cool thing is that Objective-C & Swift code can run side by side (and C code too!).

I have no idea of how to define private or public objects and methods. I also have no idea of how Blocks and multi-threading work on Swift.

Xcode is very unstable.
